	<div id="textContainer">
	<center>The purpose of this website is to provide police crime statistics that can be used to monitor crime. <br/>This may help police departments to take better criminal policy measures in the respective city.<br/>
	The development of crime in Germany is of great interest not only for the security authorities, but also for politics, research and other areas. Only if the development of crime is known can appropriate crime policy and preventive measures be taken. Therefore, crime in Germany is observed from different perspectives.<p/><br/>
	In our data set, information was collected on how many non-German suspects (f/m) exist in different cities in Germany and these were subdivided into different age groups and different criminal offences.
